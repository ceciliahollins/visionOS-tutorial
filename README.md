# visionOS-tutorial
A project to practice and demonstrate functionality of visionOS frameworks

## Description

This project is intended to be used to explore the visionOS frameworks and assist others in learning how to develop for visionOS. To do this, a Spotify remake app is created using static data. This allows for exploration into the basics of visionOS frameworks as introduced in WWDC23. The current project only explores developing for windows, with volumes and spaces to come in future work.
